# Notion API MCP Bridge

## Overview
The Notion API MCP Bridge enables Claude to interact with Notion through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The bridge provides a comprehensive set of tools for managing todo lists, databases, and content organization through Notion's API.

## Architecture
- **Async Implementation**: Built on async Python for optimal performance
- **Type Safety**: Uses Pydantic for robust data validation
- **Clean MCP Integration**: Direct protocol implementation for Claude communication
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Detailed error responses and recovery

## Notion Structure
- **Master Integration Page**: All operations stem from a root integration page (ID: 173dd75664058016b7e0dc9aee0a97d6)
- **Child Databases**: Structured data is organized in child databases under the master page:
  - Todos/Tasks
  - Projects
  - Meeting notes
  - Other structured content
- **Hierarchy**:
  - Master Page → Child Databases → Individual Entries
  - All operations reference either the master page or its child databases
  - Database IDs are derived from the master page's child blocks
